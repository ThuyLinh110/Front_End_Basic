First we login from Admin account to add new orders & room reservation. We did a sample reservation. You can see how this procedure flows. On the checkout form client can pay via Debit or Credit card. This card number is verified against an algorithm. Later in the video we showed a single search field that can be used to do search from database by putting any type of Data either ID or name. Then we login from kitchen account where you can see TO-DO list. This list is the list of orders that the kitchen staff has to fulfil. Kitchen staff can also change order details & can look into details of room orders.</p>
